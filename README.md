The Captain thinks a mutiny is underway on the Tuberosum, but is that the only threat the ship faces?  As the ship's Security Officer it's your job to save the ship and her crew, but you can only brig a single crew member at a time. Can you save the Tuberosum?

Theme - Minimalism:
 * Minimal Abilities: You can walk, listen, call red alert, and brig. No guns, No powers.
 * Minimal HUD: The only HUD element is the brig option.
 * Minimal Style: Explore a clean modern spaceship with a crew of simple stylized aliens.
